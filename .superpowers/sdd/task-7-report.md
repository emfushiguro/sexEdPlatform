# Task 7: Verify chat authorization and complete workflow

## Scope and outcome

- Added `test_learner_direct_chat_requires_a_fully_verified_parent_child_relationship` to `tests/Feature/Chat/ChatChannelAuthorizationTest.php`.
- The test proves a pending parent-child relationship is denied, approval without `relationship_verified_at` remains denied, and approval plus a timestamp is allowed.
- The RED run reproduced a production defect: `ChatAuthorizationService::hasApprovedParentChildRelation()` accepted `verification_status = approved` without requiring `relationship_verified_at`.
- Applied the minimal scoped correction in `app/Services/Chat/ChatAuthorizationService.php`: `->whereNotNull('relationship_verified_at')`.

## Required verification

All commands were run sequentially.

| Command | Exit | Exact result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `php artisan test tests/Feature/Parent/ParentChildInvitationFlowTest.php tests/Feature/Auth/ParentChildVerificationResubmissionTest.php tests/Feature/Admin/AdminParentChildVerificationModerationWorkflowTest.php tests/Feature/Admin/AdminParentChildVerificationUiTest.php tests/Feature/Chat` | 0 | `Tests: 95 passed (581 assertions)`; `Duration: 37.15s` |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result` (first attempt) | 124 | `command timed out after 124012 milliseconds`; no PHPUnit result output was emitted before the harness timeout. |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result` (rerun with extended timeout) | 0 | `OK (917 tests, 4111 assertions)`; `Time: 02:45.562, Memory: 250.00 MB` |
| `vendor\\bin\\pint --test` in sandbox | 1 | `The path "C:\Users\Jaded\ConciousConnections" is not readable.` |
| `vendor\\bin\\pint --test` outside sandbox | 1 | `FAIL ... 1109 files, 668 style issues`; repository-wide formatting debt, not modified by Task 7. |
| `vendor\\bin\\pint --test app\\Services\\Chat\\ChatAuthorizationService.php tests\\Feature\\Chat\\ChatChannelAuthorizationTest.php` | 1 | `FAIL ... 2 files, 1 style issue`; output was `⨯.`: the test file passed, while the existing service file has a style issue. |
| `vendor\\bin\\pint --test tests\\Feature\\Chat\\ChatChannelAuthorizationTest.php` | 0 | `PASS ... 1 file` |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpstan analyse --level=9` | 1 | Unavailable: PowerShell could not resolve `vendor\\bin\\phpstan`; `vendor\\bin\\phpstan` and `vendor\\bin\\phpstan.bat` both do not exist. No static-analysis coverage is claimed. |

## Diff and review

- `git diff --check` exited 1 due to pre-existing unrelated whitespace errors in `resources/views/auth/create-child-account.blade.php:231` and `resources/views/auth/parent-registration-required.blade.php:94`; it also printed unrelated CRLF warnings.
- `git diff --check -- app/Services/Chat/ChatAuthorizationService.php tests/Feature/Chat/ChatChannelAuthorizationTest.php` exited 0.
- Final code review traced the regression test through `evaluateStart()` to `hasApprovedParentChildRelation()`. The change affects only learner-to-learner direct-chat eligibility and requires the same two fields used by `ParentChildAccount::isVerified()`.
- Pre-existing dirty changes were preserved. Only the Task 7 regression test, its necessary production correction, and this report are intended for the Task 7 commit.

## Follow-up review fixes

### Scope and behavior

- `GuardianRelationshipVerificationService::submitStaged()` now accepts an optional typed `Closure` executed after the under-review transition, inside its transaction and restoration `try` block.
- Proof-required invitation acceptance updates its accepted status and clears staged metadata through that callback. A thrown invitation update now restores moved files before the outer transaction rolls back.
- Acceptance reloads the invitation with `lockForUpdate()`, revalidates pending/expiry state, locks the learner before link lookup, and locks the existing link lookup.
- Empty or null staged proof metadata now raises `A staged verification document is missing.` before any relationship creation attempt, under-review transition, or notification.
- Restored/deleted links clear `verification_document_path` with the other child-verification state.
- Failure-injection tests now install a temporary model event dispatcher and restore the saved dispatcher in `finally`; no test calls `flushEventListeners()`.

### TDD evidence

Initial RED — `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result tests\\Feature\\Parent\\ParentChildInvitationFlowTest.php`

```text
There were 4 failures:
1) empty staged proof metadata was accepted.
2) accepted invitation update failure left the source staged file missing.
3) a stale invitation decision was accepted.
4) a restored deleted link retained child-verifications/legacy-child.pdf.
FAILURES!
Tests: 19, Assertions: 113, Failures: 4.
```

Strengthened empty-proof ordering RED:

```text
1) Tests\Feature\Parent\ParentChildInvitationFlowTest::test_accepting_proof_required_invitation_with_empty_staged_documents_leaves_state_unchanged
Failed asserting that true is false.
FAILURES!
Tests: 1, Assertions: 7, Failures: 1.
```

The final strengthened focused regression passed: `OK (1 test, 7 assertions)`.

### Follow-up verification

All PHPUnit invocations were direct and sequential with `--do-not-cache-result`.

| Command | Exit | Exact result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Each of the four focused regressions | 0 | `OK (1 test, 6 assertions)`, `OK (1 test, 6 assertions)`, `OK (1 test, 3 assertions)`, and `OK (1 test, 2 assertions)` |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result tests\\Feature\\Parent\\ParentChildInvitationFlowTest.php` | 0 | Final run: `OK (19 tests, 126 assertions)`; `Time: 00:29.772` |
| Task 7 affected suites via direct PHPUnit | 0 | `OK (99 tests, 598 assertions)`; `Time: 00:37.667` |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result` | 0 | Final run: `OK (921 tests, 4129 assertions)`; `Time: 02:17.957, Memory: 250.00 MB` |
| `vendor\\bin\\pint --test tests\\Feature\\Parent\\ParentChildInvitationFlowTest.php` | 0 | `PASS ... 1 file` |
| Final scoped Pint for both services plus the test | 1 | `FAIL ... 3 files, 2 style issues`; the test passed, while both services retain pre-existing style issue groups. |
| `git diff --check --` for the two services and invitation-flow test | 0 | No whitespace errors. |

The first multi-name `--filter` attempt did not execute PHPUnit because the shell parsed `|` as a pipeline; it exited 1 before tests started. It was replaced by sequential direct PHPUnit commands above.

## Final reviewer compensation fix

### Scope and behavior

- `GuardianRelationshipVerificationService::submitStaged()` now accepts an optional by-reference moved-file ledger and exposes narrowly scoped `restoreStagedDocuments()` compensation.
- `respondToInvitation()` owns the ledger for its outer transaction, passes it during proof acceptance, and compensates after any outer transaction failure.
- Inner `submitStaged()` compensation remains active. It clears the shared ledger after restoration, so outer compensation is a no-op on already-restored moves; individual restoration failures are logged without masking the original exception.
- Moved staged proofs are therefore restored when the final accepted invitation `fresh()` retrieval fails after `submitStaged()` returns and the outer database transaction rolls back.
- `Closure` import ordering in `GuardianRelationshipVerificationService` is corrected.

### TDD evidence

RED — `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result tests\\Feature\\Parent\\ParentChildInvitationFlowTest.php --filter test_acceptance_restores_staged_documents_when_outer_transaction_fails_after_submission`

```text
FAILURES!
Tests: 1, Assertions: 2, Failures: 1.
Unable to find a file or directory at path [guardian-relationship-invitations/outer-rollback/invitation-fresh.pdf].
```

The temporary `ParentChildInvitation` retrieved listener throws only for the accepted final `fresh()` model. The regression asserts the source file is restored, the destination directory is empty, no relationship exists, and the pending invitation retains its staged metadata. The saved model event dispatcher is restored in `finally`.

GREEN — same command after implementation and again after scoped Pint:

```text
OK (1 test, 6 assertions)
```

### Final verification

All PHPUnit commands were direct and sequential with `--do-not-cache-result`.

| Command | Exit | Exact result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Focused outer-transaction regression | 0 | `OK (1 test, 6 assertions)`; final post-Pint rerun: `OK (1 test, 6 assertions)` |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result tests\\Feature\\Parent\\ParentChildInvitationFlowTest.php` | 0 | `OK (20 tests, 132 assertions)` |
| Invitation affected suites (`ParentChildInvitationFlowTest`, parent-child resubmission, both admin verification suites, and `tests\\Feature\\Chat`) | 0 | `OK (100 tests, 605 assertions)` |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result` | 0 | `OK (922 tests, 4135 assertions)`; `Time: 02:28.716` |
| `vendor\\bin\\pint` then `vendor\\bin\\pint --test` for the two services and invitation-flow test | 0 | Pint fixed one scoped formatting issue; final scoped check passed all 3 files. |
| `php -l` for both services and the test | 0 | No syntax errors in all 3 files. |
| `git diff --check --` for both services and the invitation-flow test | 0 | No whitespace errors. |

## Final review isolation fix

The final review identified two interaction gaps. Legacy child-verification lists/counts and mutation endpoints now require a non-null `verification_document_path`, so invitation-created relationships remain exclusively in the relationship-verification workflow. Invitation creation now locks the learner row before duplicate relationship/invitation checks; acceptance uses the same lock order and rejects an already approved/pending active link.

Added regression coverage for invitation relationships being absent from the child queue and blocked from legacy child approval. Updated the avatar UI fixture to keep child-registration and relationship rows distinct.

Final verification:

| Command | Exit | Exact result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Affected suites (invitation, child resubmission, admin verification/dashboard, chat) | 0 | `OK (105 tests, 637 assertions)` |
| `vendor\\bin\\phpunit --do-not-cache-result` | 0 | `OK (923 tests, 4141 assertions)`; `Time: 02:27.111` |
| `php -l` for all final touched PHP files | 0 | No syntax errors in all 7 files |
| Scoped `vendor\\bin\\pint --test` (invitation service + two admin tests) | 0 | `PASS ... 3 files` |
| Scoped `git diff --check` | 0 | No whitespace errors |
| PHPStan | unavailable | `vendor\\bin\\phpstan` and `.bat` do not exist |

The final fix could not be staged/committed because `.git` is read-only in the sandbox and the escalated Git write request was rejected after the session authentication changed. All code remains applied on the current main working tree; prior Task 7 commits remain at `6872c68`.

# Educational Events Task 7: Delivery link management and notices

## Scope

- Added narrow connector and admin delivery updates for published or completed external events only.
- Validated HTTP(S) links and release/expiry times in Philippine local time, stored in UTC.
- Added a shared management form and safe queued mail/database notices. Notice payloads contain the protected event page route, never the external URL.
- Recipient selection includes currently eligible confirmed registrants and accepted speakers, deduplicated by user ID. Admin changes also copy the connector organizer.
- The update locks the event row, changes only five delivery fields, resets the availability marker when release time changes, and logs notification dispatch failures after saving.

## TDD evidence

- RED: `php vendor/bin/phpunit --do-not-cache-result tests/Feature/Connectors/SeminarDeliveryManagementTest.php tests/Feature/Admin/AdminSeminarDeliveryTest.php` returned five expected `RouteNotFoundException` errors for the missing delivery actions.
- GREEN: `php vendor/bin/phpunit --do-not-cache-result tests/Feature/Connectors/SeminarDeliveryManagementTest.php tests/Feature/Admin/AdminSeminarDeliveryTest.php tests/Feature/Seminars/SeminarExternalAccessTest.php` returned `OK (15 tests, 98 assertions)`.
- PHP syntax checks passed for all new PHP files. `git diff --check` reported no whitespace errors.

## Boundary

The separate action rejects draft, pending-review, approved, cancelled, archived, native, and in-person events. Prepublication delivery edits remain in the existing authoring form and do not trigger this notice flow.

## Review follow-up

- Added a stale-request regression: a release-time update succeeds, then a second update based on the old route model tries to set custom expiry before the new release. RED accepted the invalid expiry; GREEN rejects it with 422 and preserves the valid row. The delivery service now checks the merged proposed values while holding the row lock, including the event-end release boundary.
- Added an admin-with-connector-permission regression through the connector route. RED sent an organizer notice; GREEN sends none. Only the admin route passes the explicit admin-action context that includes the organizer. The existing admin-route test still confirms one notice after deduplication.
- Combined Task 7 management/admin and Task 6 external-access suites: `OK (17 tests, 106 assertions)`. PHP syntax checks and `git diff --check` passed.
